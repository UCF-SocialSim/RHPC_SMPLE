I modified the first two entries in the list of chapters to change the way the hyperref works; it looked odd to me  to just have the chapter number be in blue, so I tried a couple of variations- Chapter 2 (where the name and number of the chapter are the link) and Chapter 3 (where the chapter title is the link). Pick one of these (possibly including the original way) and make them all standard; you may also find that other examples throughout the text can be converted. If it's burdensome we can probably define a command to do it in a simpler way.


1.2 Acknowledgements
	Add: Bruce Miller will have the correct wording and project number for SocialSim.
        Possible: Move entire 'Acknowledgements' section to its own 'chapter', after the table of contents but still in the Latex 'frontmatter' section.
